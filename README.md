# Book Repository
## Description
This program was completed during my scripting and programming computer science course. This class was an introduction in using object-oriented principles, data types, control structures, pointers, memory allocation, and functions. Using these principles, I wrote this program to model the book repository.
## Project Objectives 
1. Use object-oriented design to model a book repository.
1. Get familiar using pointers and understand the fundamentals of memory management.
1. Use encapsulation in each class and provide getters and setters for the class attributes.
## Technologies Used
1. C++
1. Netbeans IDE
